Ok, I just will not just load one node without a map.

I create, just like chix-compile.

A map with unconnected nodes, with their test data and run that.

This doesn't cover the api test yet though with twigs/actions
Anyway, that's just a matter of creating the graph and also
providing a test.json along with it for fixture data.
